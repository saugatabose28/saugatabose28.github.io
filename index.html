      <p>
	  <li><strong> Binary Data Mastery: Advanced File Handling and Reverse Engineering</strong>
	  <br>

	  As the Project Lead , I oversaw and guided a cohort of approximately 100 members through the successful execution of this high-tech assignment. The project encompassed two pivotal programming task assignments that centered on adeptly manipulating binary data stored in files utilizing the Unix I/O interface. In the initial stage, groups focused on initializing a C struct and presenting it as formatted text, a process crucial for developing proficiency in declaring and initializing C structs, and employing precise formatting via printf for diverse data types. Stage 2 involved advanced binary file processing, necessitating adeptness in file handling, binary data extraction, and leveraging command-line parameters for dynamic file processing.

Progressing to Stage 3, the emphasis shifted to the strategic sorting of binary data files within a known format. This demanded adeptness in file manipulation strategies, dynamic memory allocation, and efficient utilization of system library routines for optimal sorting. Finally, Stage 4 unveiled the challenge of reverse engineering an enigmatic data file format. This stage honed crucial skills in recognizing and interpreting varied binary data formats and seamlessly converting data across disparate formats.

<br>Our success in this project underscores our prowess in teamwork, precise communication, and the application of fundamental programming skills. It demonstrates our collective ability to navigate intricate challenges and deliver results proficiently, significantly elevating our understanding of advanced binary data handling in contemporary IT landscapes.

	  <p>
	  <li><strong> Integrated Software Quality Assurance and Testing Analysis</strong>

	  <br>
	  This project encompasses three key tasks centered around software quality assurance (SQA) processes and software testing. In the first task, we study the SQA process of a designated open source software project or a similar one (we examine Apache Kafka), analyzing verification and validation activities, testing frameworks, specific testing and analysis processes, and other relevant aspects. The second task involves a comprehensive review of five selected testing tools (Selenium, Postman REST Client, Splinter, Appium and PYtest), followed by the creation and execution of over 1,000 unique test cases for a chosen software application, aiming to detect and report failures linked to the bug tracking system. EvoSuite was used to generate automatic test cases. The third task focuses on exploring a bug dataset (we examine Defects4j which contains 835 bugs plus 29 deprecated bugs), understanding its projects and defects, identifying relevant test cases and techniques for specific bugs, attempting code modifications to rectify these, and optionally discovering new bugs or investigating automatic repair tools applied to the dataset. This project aims to impart a thorough understanding of software quality assurance, testing tools, and bug analysis, encouraging practical application and enhancing students' proficiency in ensuring software quality and reliability.

<br>We detect and fix bugs from following projects of Defects4j - jfreechart, commons-cli, closure-compiler, commons-codec, commons-collections, commons-compress, commons-csv, gson, jackson-core, jackson-databind, jackson-dataformat-xml, jsoup, commons-jxpath, commons-lang, commons-math, Mockito and joda-time.

<br>Automatic software repairs tools- NOPOL, Elixir are examined to fix bugs in a program, JIRA was used for tracking project progress.	  
	</p>

	  <p>
	  <li><strong> Binary Bomb Defusal</strong>

	  <br>The “Binary Bomb Defusal” project presented a unique challenge that required a deep understanding of binary programs and a keen eye for detail. The task involved a binary bomb program with multiple phases, each requiring specific input to proceed. The stakes were high, as any incorrect input would result in a virtual ‘explosion,’ and there was a limited time to defuse the bomb.

To tackle this challenge, we utilized various strategies and tools. We employed debugging tools like gdb to gain insights into the program’s operation. A crucial part of the process was understanding and interpreting assembly code, which allowed us to decipher the requirements for each phase of the bomb program.

<br>We also applied control constructs analysis to understand the flow of the program better and predict its behavior based on different inputs. One of the significant challenges we faced was potential buffer overflow exploits, which we addressed by carefully analyzing the program and ensuring that our inputs did not exceed the allocated memory.

<br>This project was not just about defusing a binary bomb; it was about enhancing our debugging skills for real-world scenarios. It emphasized problem-solving and critical thinking abilities, skills that are invaluable in the field of computer science. Through this project, we learned to navigate complex challenges and deliver solutions under pressure.

	<p>
	  <li><strong> CyberSec Innovation: Entropy-Driven Attack Detection & Web Tracking Solutions</strong>

	  <br>We meticulously analyze server-log data, harnessing entropy analysis to unearth attack methodologies and strengthen network security. Isolation Forest takes the lead, outperforming Local Outlier Factor in speed and accuracy for detecting outliers. Identifying attack anomalies hinges on spotting non-standard services and telnet requests. The pivotal role of entropy in attack detection cannot be overstated; it facilitates the identification of anomalies by assessing combinations of IP addresses and ports. Yet, detecting attacks with similar IP addresses and ports poses challenges, underlining the need for diverse models and comparative analysis for effective anomaly detection.

<br>Within the realm of machine learning, our mission is to pioneer a model differentiating between functional and tracking JavaScript codes. We leverage TF-IDF for feature extraction and meticulous experimentation to elevate web tracking security. Our toolkit comprises three models: One-Class SVM, K-Means (k=2), and SVC, representing PU Learning and Supervised Learning for thorough evaluation. We apply TF-IDF to both functional and tracking JavaScript files and meticulously partition the data into training and testing sets. One-Class SVM, initially set with 50% contamination, delivers a 56% AUC, further enhanced to 61% AUC with contamination adjustments. K-Means (k=2) yields a more modest AUC of 41% compared to OCSVM. However, SVC emerges as the star player, displaying exceptional results (99.7% AUC, 99.5% TPR, 0% FPR), which may initially hint at overfitting but is confirmed otherwise through cross-validation. This underscores the pivotal role of classifier selection, with supervised learning, particularly SVC, demonstrating its mettle in delivering accuracy and task effectiveness.

   	<p>
	<li><strong> Machine Learning Mastery in Classification, Clustering, and Anomaly Detection</strong>

	  <br>Leading a team of approximately 35 members, our mission centered on executing a comprehensive data analysis utilizing machine learning models for classification, clustering, and anomaly detection across three diverse datasets. Python, alongside essential libraries like pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn, served as our primary toolkit for implementing robust data analysis programs. In Task 1, addressing multi-class classification within Landsat Satellite Data demanded careful hyperparameter tuning for K-NN and decision tree classifiers. Task 2 posed the challenge of clustering on unprocessed power consumption data, necessitating thoughtful feature extraction, addressing missing values, and standardization. Task 3 involved building a predictive model for anomaly detection in network traffic data, distinguishing between intrusions and normal connections, leveraging methods like Mahalanobis distance, KNN distance, LOF, and iForest. Our diligent approach emphasized performance evaluation, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning, ensuring model reliability and robustness, all reported and visualized meticulously for informed decision-making. Through a structured and thorough approach, we successfully implemented and gleaned valuable insights from diverse data analysis tasks.

	<li><strong> Short-text classificaiton: Implementing BERT based Deep NN-V1.1</strong>

	  <br>The proposed model synergizes advanced deep learning methodologies, integrating a cutting-edge encoder model, BERT, and a recurrent neural network (RNN). This amalgamation presents a contemporary perspective on anomaly detection, particularly excelling in discerning intricate linguistic subtleties and peculiar speech patterns within concise textual data. The model conceptualizes anomaly detection through a binary classification lens. 

<br>Performance evaluation is conducted leveraging four publicly accessible datasets: Davidson, SemEval-2019 (Task-5, Subtask-A), HASOC-2019 (Sub-task B), and Stormfront. The implementation harnesses Python as primary programming language and employs PyTorch, TensorFlow, NumPy, and Scikit-Transformers as pivotal frameworks for computation and visualization.
</p>	

<p>
	<li><strong> Hate Speech Detection: Binary vs One Class-V1</strong>

	  <br>I conduct extensive experimentation involving hate speech detection models and identify a prevalent issue in existing models—a tendency to treat the problem as a binary detection model despite the dataset's imbalanced nature. Non-hate speeches contribute significantly to the dataset, making hate speech's definition challenging when compared to cyberbullying, racism, and related domains. To address this, I engineer several models, including SVM-based, LSTM-based, and CNN-based models, utilizing fast text word embedding and GloVe word embedding while still framing the problem as binary.

Subsequently, I devise a novel approach, reframing the problem as the construction of a single-class model focused exclusively on detecting hate speech. The model is exclusively trained on hate class data, leveraging deep-trained features. Performance evaluation is comprehensive, utilizing four publicly accessible datasets: Davidson, SemEval-2019 (Task-5, Subtask-A), HASOC-2019 (Sub-task B), and Stormfront. 

<br>My implementation predominantly employs MATLAB, leveraging its Deep Learning Toolbox as the primary framework.</p>

      <li><strong>LexiFusedNet: A Unified Approach for Imbalanced Short-text Classification using Lexicon-based Feature Extraction, Transfer Learning and One Class Classifiers</strong>
      <br>
      <strong>Saugata Bose</strong>, Guoxin Su
	  <br>
	  Summary: 
	  <em>By merging lexicon-driven feature extraction with a transfer learning-oriented deep neural network, significant improvements are observed. This lexicon approach assigns significance to key terms in brief texts, and the subsequent fine-tuning harnesses this weighted information. By bolstering contextual word embeddings with these lexicon values, the text's interpretability is enriched. Techniques such as OCSVM or SVDD, under the one-class classification loss umbrella, pinpoint anomalies based on word significance. Comprehensive tests across four standard datasets confirm superior results in classifying short texts, effectively tackling challenges posed by data disparities, context constraints, and noise.

      <br>
      <strong>Saugata Bose</strong>, Guoxin Su, Li Liu
	  <br>Summery:
	  <em>The abundance of user-generated online content has presented significant challenges in handling big data. One challenge involves analyzing short posts on social media, ranging from sentiment identification to abusive content detection. Despite recent advancements in pre-trained language models and transfer learning for textual data analysis, the classification performance is hindered by imbalanced data, where anomalous data represents only a small portion of the dataset. To address this, we propose Deep One-Class Fine-Tuning (DOCFT), a versatile method for fine-tuning transfer learning-based textual classifiers. DOCFT uses a one-class SVM-style hyperplane to encapsulate anomalous data. This approach involves a two-step fine-tuning process and utilizes an alternating optimization method based on a custom OC-SVM loss function and quantile regression. Through evaluations on four different hate-speech datasets, we observe that significant performance improvements can be achieved by our method.

      <li><strong>Deep One-Class Hate Speech Detection Model</strong>
      <br>
      <strong>Saugata Bose</strong>, Guoxin Su
	  <br>Summery:
	  <em>Hate speech detection for social media posts is considered as a binary classification problem in existing approaches, largely neglecting distinct attributes of hate speeches from other sentimental types such as “aggressive” and “racist”. As these sentimental types constitute a significant major portion of data, the classification performance is compromised. Moreover, those classifiers often do not generalize well across different datasets due to a relatively small number of hate-class samples. In this paper, we adopt a one-class perspective for hate speech detection, where the detection classifier is trained with hate-class samples only. Our model employs a BERT-BiLSTM module for feature extraction and a one-class SVM for classification. A comprehensive evaluation with four benchmarking datasets demonstrates the better performance of our model than existing approaches, as well as the advantage of training our model with a combination of the four datasets.

      <br>
      Ritambhra Korpal, <strong>Saugata Bose (co-first author)</strong>
	  <br>Summery:
	  <em>In response to the increasing prevalence of copy-paste practices leading to plagiarism, this paper explores an initiative that combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and supervised machine learning algorithms to automatically detect plagiarized texts. The primary focus is on constructing a framework capable of successfully identifying external plagiarism within monolingual texts. The framework utilizes an n-gram frequency comparison approach and is built upon 120 characteristics extracted through NLP preprocessing. Filter metrics are applied to select the most relevant characteristics, followed by the use of a supervised classification learning algorithm to categorize documents into four levels of plagiarism. The evaluation, based on a confusion matrix, demonstrates a remarkable accuracy score of 89% with minimal false positives and false negatives, signifying the efficacy of our plagiarism detection framework.
